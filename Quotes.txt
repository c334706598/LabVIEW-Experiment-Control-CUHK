Physics is very muddled again at the moment; it is much too hard for me anyway, and I wish I were a movie comedian or something like that and had never heard anything about physics! --WOLFGANG PAULI
Physics is littered with the corpses of dead unified field theories. --FREEMAN DYSON
All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial. --ERNEST RUTHERFORD
No two electrons in the same state? That is why atoms are so unnecessarily big, and why metal and stone are so bulky. (Explaining that atoms are as large as they are because of Wolfgang Pauli’s Principle.) --PAUL EHRENFEST
The condition of matter I have dignified by the term Electronic, THE ELECTRONIC STATE. What do you think of that? Am I not a bold man, ignorant as I am, to coin words? --MICHAEL FARADAY
We cannot define anything precisely! If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, ‘You don’t know what you are talking about!’ The second one says ‘What do you mean by know? What do you mean by talking? What do you mean by you?’, and so on. --RICHARD FEYNMAN
There are many ways of knocking electrons out of atoms. The simplest is to rub two surfaces together. --FRED HOYLE
